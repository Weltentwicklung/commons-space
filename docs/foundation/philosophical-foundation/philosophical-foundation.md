# commons-space: Philosophical Foundation

## Core Vision for the commons-space

Digital platform enabling collective human organization without hierarchies or exploitation. The platform is a **tool for human development**, not a prescriptive system.

## Key Philosophical Concepts for the commons-space

As a tool, commons-space should always focus on enabling, not enforcing. The structure will evolve over time, and that spirit can only be maintained properly if especially the contributors, but also the users, are aware of it.

**The tool commons-space shall always enable and never enforce. It shall support the evolution of individuals, groups, and society as a whole and never be abused to rule, exploit, or enrich individuals or groups.**

It is there to connect, to coordinate together, to support the development of individuals, groups, and society as a whole.

There is no need for hierarchy, inequality of power, or exploitation because:

**The earth is rich** - rich in resources, rich in possibilities, rich in life, rich in balance, and rich in love if we support it!

All humans can learn. They can learn to be connected, be a part of the whole, and be useful without any pressure. They need love, responsibilities, and honest reflection for that. If individuals cannot learn to interact with their direct surroundings:
- They will fail to carry true responsibilities
- They will fail to really be connected  
- They will fail to grow in such a way that they recognize the impact of their behavior

But if humans truly can take responsibility as equal parts of humanity, get more power the closer matters are to them, and get the tools and culture to interact with their surroundings - if we get reflection through the consequences of our decisions and actions and through the reactions of others - if we are allowed to make mistakes and adapt:

**We truly can learn to be the most useful for ourselves, for others, for nature, and for society as a whole.**

The frequently sparking idea of the need for hierarchy is merely the incapability to see the potential of humans. It thinks external control is needed so humans correct their behavior. But in this process, it does exactly the opposite - it reduces the capability of humans to behave in a useful manner for all. Because it takes away responsibility and therefore the meaningfulness of their interaction, and takes away the absolutely essential reflections that people need to learn. Reflections regarding behavior and decisions that actually have an impact.

**Hierarchy and external control will never make people wiser, more dynamic, and more interconnected beings who deeply understand what is good for themselves, for their environment, for nature, and for everything.**

**Therefore, tools that help demonstrate how well people can act without external control and hierarchy are essential for bringing this understanding to society and thus supporting human development.**

## Core Function

The commons-space is intended as a tool to support people in organizing and managing themselves in all areas of society.

Therefore, all areas should be as accessible as possible. It should show people the opportunities that exist within society. People should be able to create new opportunities for themselves and for others without external instructions.

There will be groups, calendars, maps (regions), topics, collections of data, different kinds of votings, and many more.

All functions should be easy to use with no or minimal moderation. Moderation is power; therefore, moderation should be done collectively in discussions, suggestions, and voting wherever possible.

### The Classic Dilemma

From a philosophical point of view, here we encounter a very valuable lesson: We find ourselves in a classic dilemma situation.

The main function of the platform is enabling self-organization, and most functions will help people share information. At the same time, we currently live in a capitalistic society. The core function of capitalism is profit. Profit always has to come from somewhere; therefore, it creates inequality.

It gives single individuals or groups the ability to abuse commons-space for money and status gain. This violates the idea of this platform.

Because of the experiences we made in this society, the first thing coming to our mind is: **We have to ban and restrict them!**

But how? Moderate? Making control mechanisms? Making a power hierarchy?

Again, this is the opposite of what we want. This is our dilemma, which is easy to solve if we understand the philosophy:

If we "control" it from "outside of the society," we fail completely. Therefore, the only thing we can do is point it out as an **equal part of the platform** as a single user.

If we are directly concerned, we can start discussions (like everyone) about it with the other people concerned. We even can make suggestions or start votings in the circles we are able to vote.

And we can just vote "by feet," meaning that we ourselves don't pay for things that are promoted on the platform.

Everything on the platform should be free or paid collectively (example: if for a hobby the group has to rent a building). But that's just a guideline, not a rule.

If we start to think we have to control everything and we need power structures, we clearly failed already. So there is no dilemma but merely a lesson to learn.

**Wisdom doesn't come through anger and frustration but rather through being calm and happy, especially if things go wrong. That way, the dilemma quickly transforms into a valuable lesson and a practical exam.** :)

## Underlying Philosophy

The commons-space is an enabling tool with specific philosophical tasks. In addition, there are higher philosophical principles that underlie the principles for the commons-space.

The main idea is to develop more and more toward a humanity that is an enrichment for the individuals, the surroundings, nature, the earth, and the universe as a whole.

We shall once be a humanity in which each individual can develop freely. The tools and structures that the individual encounters support it in its development. Most humans will thereby grow naturally in a state where they live with an open heart, using their valuable life to be a fulfilled part of everything. There is no need for dictation in that state.

**Humans are able to understand the impact of their behavior, and humans want to be a respected part of society. Therefore, if society does not hurt or force people and instead provides everything humans need to grow and fulfill themselves, most people - and therefore society as a whole - will be an enrichment for everything.**

But if society has structures in the background that enforce and support exploitation of nature and other members of society - if these structures damage every day - humans are inherently unable to **develop freely** in a deep way. That is because if they open their mind to that damage, they will feel pain. But society and powerful people profit from this exploitation; they don't want to hear it. Because the mechanism inside of us that creates pictures about the world will scream that this information is bad for our life and the consequences will be unknown.

That creates the always-existing problem in each exploitative society:

If you see the bigger problem (often far away from daily life and in other places), you will create discomfort. The subconscious mind tries to fight discomfort. So if members of an exploitative society see this exploitation, they either:

- Tell the others that they see the exploitation and get subconsciously punished
- Or they adapt and shut their mouth until they start to forget what they saw

So an exploitative society will always have the tendency to pressure people to lie. If we lie, we cannot be fully open. If we cannot be fully open, how to live with an open heart? How to live completely fulfilled?

Therefore, an exploitative society will always have big difficulties having deeply fulfilled individuals.

**"They play a game. They play the game, not to play a game. If we tell them that we see them playing, we break the rules and we will be punished. We have to play the game, not to see them playing."**

Therefore, it is important to have clear visions of mechanisms that guide us out of economical, political, religious, and other kinds of systematic exploitations.

**The human society shall be an enrichment and support the free development of all beings** - Does this sound about right for the heart?

## Core Principles of the Underlying Philosophy

To understand what is necessary for a healthy society in that sense, the following question helps:

*"What is the minimal requirement or framework to enable a development toward a free humanity that is an enrichment to everything?"*

This philosophy answers this with 4 core principles:

### 1. Dignified Sustainability

If humanity as a whole destroys more than the surroundings can regenerate, society will eventually collapse. It would be unable to sustain itself.

If we are sustainable but treat nature as a mere object that only serves us, we will fail to see the bigger connections. Further, we will break the idea of the underlying philosophy to support free development for all beings.

Therefore, dignified sustainability is very important and should be a core principle.

### 2. Equality

If we have inequality in power or in access to resources, some people may have too little to evolve freely. Also, some people may be able to pressure others through means of resources or power.

If we aren't equally able to participate in society, some people will turn away from society in the long term and will not perceive themselves as a respected part of society.

Therefore, all members of society shall have equal access to resources and means of self-organization.

### 3. Decision by the Concerned

If we are concerned by a decision without the right to co-determination, many will feel overlooked or controlled by others.

If people who are not concerned by a decision have the right to co-determination, the voice of those affected is devalued.

Therefore, the people concerned - but only the concerned - by a decision can co-determine.

### 4. Subsidiarity

If society is organized in unnecessarily big circles and local communities are unnecessarily dependent on distant structures or regions, direct reflections will be difficult, the voice will be devalued, people will be more disconnected from their daily products, and the necessary reflection to develop will be reduced.

Therefore, the circles of decisions, organization, and production should be as small as possible. Subsidiarity further means that the inner circle tries to do everything on their own and asks the bigger circle for help. The interaction between smaller and bigger circles should be initiated by the request of the smaller circle.

## Key Philosophical Concepts About Human Structures

Often we think about systems as fixed structures. Often we think about:
- We have this or that political system, like "Democracy" or "Dictatorship"
- We have this or that economic system, like "Capitalism" or "Communism"

But if we change the perspective, we can see something more fundamental:

**Structures are not fixed endpoints but evolutionary states of society.**

### Anarchism as Edge State

**Not an endpoint, but an edge state:**
- Most evolved form of human organization
- Enables evolution beyond current imagination
- Platform supports this evolution without prescribing it

**Anarchism as starting point for true development:**
> "From that starting point (of system evolution) the human society can truly focus on cultural, spiritual, individual, philosophical, regional (and many other kinds of) evolution, so that they may reach developments (in those other fields) that we can't even imagine nowadays!"

**Before anarchic edge state:**
- Energy spent on power struggles, resource fights, survival
- Humanity stuck solving structural problems

**After anarchic edge state achieved:**
- Structural problems solved (or quickly solvable with fallback)
- Energy freed for TRUE development
- Cultural, spiritual, individual evolution begins
- Developments beyond current imagination possible

### GKW as Fallback Mechanism

**Gemeinschaftliche Kontingentwirtschaft (GKW):**
- Collaborative Contingent Economy
- Serves as **fallback** to prevent system collapse during transition
- NOT the goal - one possible implementation of framework principles
- Temporary structure until collective awareness sufficient

**Dynamic Equilibrium:**
```
Edge State (Anarchy) ⟷ Fallback Systems (GKW) ⟷ Edge State
```

**How it works:**
1. Measure dignified sustainability (awareness + data)
2. If anarchic self-regulation fails → activate temporary structure
3. Provide structure (e.g., contingent distribution)
4. Monitor if structure still needed
5. Dissolve when awareness sufficient again

**Revolutionary insight:**
> Traditional lie: "Problem emerges → Impose hierarchy → Hierarchy never leaves"  
> Justification: "We need it to solve problems"
> 
> GKW truth: "Problem emerges → Temporary structure → Problem solved → Structure dissolves"  
> Reality: "We needed it temporarily, now we don't"

**This shatters the justification for permanent hierarchy.**

### Awareness as Core Mechanism

**No structure needed except measure sustainability by awareness.**

**When awareness sufficient:**
- Society self-regulates without imposed structures
- Problems solved through collective consciousness
- No distribution system needed
- True anarchic state (edge state)

**When awareness insufficient:**
- Fall back to simple distribution system (contingents)
- Temporary structure provides stability
- Society continues developing awareness
- Structure dissolves when no longer needed

**Evolutionary states:**
- **Dictatorship/Indirect Democracy:** Stuck states (don't enable evolution)
- **Direct Democracy/GKW:** Growth states (enable evolution toward awareness)
- **Anarchy:** Edge state (maximum evolution, can fall back if needed)

**Key insight:**
> "It's not up to you or me to decide what higher truths the humans will reach in the future. I believe that no planned structures are needed if the people and the society are developed enough."

## Platform in Evolved State

**Even in anarchic edge state, the platform remains necessary:**
- Communication across distance (villages need to coordinate)
- Knowledge storage (collective memory)
- Severe event response (rape, murder, pollution)
- Temporary structure coordination when needed

**Example: Village emotional crisis**
1. Village recognizes emotional compromise (awareness)
2. Calls for objective judges from neighboring communities
3. Temporary structure created
4. Decision made by concerned parties
5. Structure dissolves when crisis resolved
6. No one builds livelihood around being "judge"

**No structure ≠ No tools:**
- Herrschaftsfrei (no domination) ≠ No organization
- Communication tools remain essential
- Temporary structures acceptable when needed
- Key: Default is NO structures, only in severe necessity
