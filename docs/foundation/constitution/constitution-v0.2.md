# Platform Constitution
## commons-space - Tool for Human Self-Organization

**Version:** 0.2 (Draft)  
**Date:** December 25, 2024  
**Status:** Foundation Document - Refinement Phase  
**Amendment Status:** Core Principles will lock at v1.0 (first public release)

---

## Preamble

This platform was created to give humanity a tool for societal development. It shall promote development in such a way that individual humans and the smallest communities become the center of local organization. In this way, people come together again and are, from birth, part of a larger whole in which they have equal rights to participate in decisions and to shape their environment.

Through this, people can develop freely and meaningfully within society. There should be as few restrictions as possible on this development. The necessary framework conditions are:

1. **Würdevolle Nachhaltigkeit** (Dignified Sustainability)
2. **Gemeinschaftlichkeit** (Collectivity) - Equal rights and equal access to resources
3. **Mitbestimmungs- und Mitgestaltungsrecht aller Betroffenen** (Right of all concerned to co-decide and co-create)
4. **Kleinteilige Verwaltung, Koordination und Organisation** (Small-scale administration, coordination, and organization)

The implementation of these framework conditions can be freely designed by people at all levels.

This platform shall contribute to dismantling hierarchical power structures and help end all exploitative structures in society. May humanity, through this and countless other efforts, become a true enrichment to society, nature, and the universe.

## Core Principles

**The Purpose of This Platform:**

This platform exists as a **tool**, not an authority. Its core functions are:

1. **Communication** - Enable people to communicate across distances
2. **Decision-Making** - Facilitate collective decisions by concerned parties
3. **Knowledge Storage** - Preserve and share collective knowledge
4. **Organization** - Help communities self-organize without hierarchies

**The Platform Is:**
- A tool for human development (not a system imposing specific structures)
- Independent and non-hierarchical
- Volunteer-run (no one earns money through the platform itself)
- Transparent in all operations
- Owned collectively by all users

**The Platform Is Not:**
- An authority making decisions for communities
- A profit-making entity
- A hierarchy or power structure
- Prescriptive about how communities should organize

**Core Principle Lock:**
These Core Principles will be locked at v1.0 (first public release). Until v1.0, refinements are possible to ensure we capture the essential values correctly. After v1.0, Core Principles cannot be changed without extraordinary consensus (see Amendment Process).

## Scope Circles

The platform supports decision-making and organization at multiple nested scales:

### 1. Individual & Small Groups
- Personal decisions
- Friend groups
- Family units
- Small informal collectives

### 2. Local Community (Residential)
- Neighborhood/Village
- Automatic membership based on primary residence
- Rights: Participate in local political, economic, and structural decisions
- Activities: Discussions, suggestions, voting on local matters

### 3. Voluntary Groups
- Hobby groups
- Project groups
- Learning groups
- Specialist groups (e.g., cosmology, engineering)
- Working groups

**Group Access Rules:**
- **Open Groups** (recommended for): Learning, working, specialist knowledge groups
  - Reason: Equal access to knowledge (Gemeinschaftlichkeit)
- **Closed/Private Groups** (allowed for): Hobby, project, trust circles
  - Reason: Safety from persecution, privacy rights
- **Hidden/Encrypted Groups** (allowed when necessary): Activism, resistance
  - Reason: Protection from powerful adversaries during transition period

### 4. Municipal/Town Level
- City or town-wide decisions
- Resource allocation
- Infrastructure

### 5. Regional Level
- Multi-town coordination
- Shared resources (rivers, forests, etc.)
- Regional planning

### 6. National/Global Level
- Coordination on large-scale issues
- Knowledge sharing across regions
- Emergency response coordination

---

## Decision-Making Principles

### Subsidiarity
- Decisions made at the smallest competent level
- Inner circles decide first
- Reach out to larger circles only when needed
- No forced escalation

### Decisions by the Concerned
- Only those affected by a decision participate in making it
- "Concerned" = directly impacted by the outcome
- Different from "interested" or "having an opinion"

### No Permanent Representatives
- Task-specific delegation is allowed (temporary, specific purpose)
- No permanent "representatives" who make decisions for others
- No one builds a career or status through delegation

---

## Suggestion & Voting Process

### 1. Discussion Phase (Optional but Recommended)
- Discuss topic before creating formal suggestion
- Refine ideas collaboratively
- Build consensus or identify competing approaches
- Platform provides discussion tools

### 2. Create Suggestion
- Any member can create suggestion (within their concerned scope)
- Must clearly state: what, why, who is concerned, expected outcome
- Open for editing by creator

### 3. Support Accumulation
- Community discusses, refines suggestion
- Supporters indicate support
- Threshold: Determined by community (guideline: 5-20% of concerned people)

### 4. Lock Point (Default: 30% support)
- At 30% support, suggestion locks - no more edits
- Prevents bait-and-switch manipulation
- Supporters backed specific text
- Lock threshold customizable by community

### 5. Automatic Vote Trigger (100% threshold or time limit)
- At 100% support OR time limit reached → becomes binding vote
- Multiple competing suggestions can go to vote simultaneously
- Vote types: modular system (see below)

### 6. Voting
- All concerned participate
- Transparency: who voted, how they voted (customizable by community)
- Results published

### 7. Implementation
- Winning suggestion becomes decision
- Community implements (or designated group for task)
- Progress trackable on platform

### Vote Types (Modular System)

**Extensible Framework:** New vote types can be added by community

**Initial Types:**

1. **Simple Yes/No**
   - Single proposal
   - Accept or reject

2. **Multiple Choice**
   - Several competing proposals
   - Choose one
   - Optional: ranked-choice elimination

3. **Budget Allocation**
   - Distribute resources across priorities
   - Each voter has points to allocate
   - Results show community priorities

4. **Consensus-Building (Resistance Measurement)**
   - Rate proposals on scale of resistance/support
   - Find proposal with least resistance
   - Useful when compromise needed

5. **Ranked Choice**
   - Rank proposals in order of preference
   - Instant-runoff elimination
   - Produces majority-supported outcome

6. **Approval Voting**
   - Vote for all acceptable options
   - Option with most approvals wins

## Group Types & Restrictions

### Transparent Groups
- Visible membership
- Public activities
- Can coordinate community resources
- Can make decisions affecting non-members (if legitimately concerned)

### Hidden/Encrypted Groups
- **Allowed** - Privacy and safety are legitimate needs
- **Restriction**: Cannot coordinate community-wide resources
- **Restriction**: Cannot make decisions affecting those outside the group
- **Reason**: Hidden groups making decisions for others contradicts transparency principle

**Why allow hidden groups?**
- Activism against unjust power requires protection
- Whistleblowers need safety
- Persecuted minorities need secure spaces
- During transition from current power structures, encryption may be necessary

**Why restrict their decision-making power?**
- Those affected by decisions deserve to know who's making them
- Resource coordination requires accountability
- Transparency prevents hidden power structures

---

## Economic Model

### Platform Itself

**Volunteer Principle:**
- All platform development and maintenance is volunteer work
- No one earns money through the platform
- No building of personal livelihood or reputation via platform
- Prevents conflicting interests

**Necessary Purchases:**
- Platform may purchase: servers, hardware, electricity, security services
- Only when no volunteer alternatives exist
- All purchases follow core principles:
  - Equal hourly wages for all laborers (based on average basket)
  - Most environmentally friendly options
  - Prefer cooperatives following same principles

**External Use:**
- Governments, organizations may use platform for their processes
- They may pay their own staff for work (vote counting, etc.)
- Platform itself remains free to use
- No fees for individuals

### Gemeinschaftliche Kontingentwirtschaft (GKW)

The platform can support the development and coordination of GKW (Collaborative Contingent Economy) but GKW is **not required**. GKW is one possible implementation of the framework principles, designed as a fallback mechanism to prevent system collapse during transition to more evolved forms of organization.

**If GKW is implemented:**
- Worker-owned cooperatives network
- Contribution-based distribution (work, need, ability)
- Local resource coordination
- Regional/global coordination for complex products

**Phase 0 (Transition within Capitalism):**
- Network of worker cooperatives
- Democratic workplaces
- Fair trade between cooperatives
- Alternative to extractive capitalism
- Bridge to post-scarcity organization

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Temporary Structures When Needed

The platform can facilitate creation of temporary structures when communities need them:

**Example: Village Emotional Crisis**
1. Village recognizes emotional compromise
2. Calls for objective arbiters (e.g., trained mediators from neighboring communities)
3. Temporary resolution process created
4. Decision made by objective concerned parties
5. Structure dissolved when crisis resolved
6. No one builds livelihood around being "arbiter"

**Key Principle:** Temporary, task-specific, dissolved after completion

---

## Amendments

### Process for Changing This Constitution

**Before v1.0:**
- Core Principles can be refined
- Structure and details can be updated
- Version numbering continues (v0.3, v0.4, etc.)

**After v1.0 (Public Release):**

**Minor Amendments** (everything except Core Principles):
- Requires: Simple majority of active participants in relevant scope
- Process: Standard suggestion → voting process

**Core Principles Amendments** (locked):
- Requires: 50% of ALL eligible voters (not just those who vote)
- Higher bar ensures fundamental values aren't changed lightly
- Eligible voters = all who have stated will to participate (including children when using guardian mechanisms)
