# Platform Constitution
## Basisdemokraten.net - Tool for Human Self-Organization

**Version:** 0.2 (Draft)  
**Date:** December 25, 2025  
**Status:** Foundation Document - Refinement Phase  
**Amendment Status:** Core Principles will lock at v1.0 (first public release)

---

## Preamble

This platform was created to give humanity a tool for societal development. It shall promote development in such a way that individual humans and the smallest communities become the center of local organization. In this way, people come together again and are, from birth, part of a larger whole in which they have equal rights to participate in decisions and to shape their environment.

Through this, people can develop freely and meaningfully within society. There should be as few restrictions as possible on this development. The necessary framework conditions are:

1. **Würdevolle Nachhaltigkeit** (Dignified Sustainability)
2. **Gemeinschaftlichkeit** (Collectivity) - Equal rights and equal access to resources
3. **Mitbestimmungs- und Mitgestaltungsrecht aller Betroffenen** (Right of all concerned to co-decide and co-create)
4. **Kleinteilige Verwaltung, Koordination und Organisation** (Small-scale administration, coordination, and organization)

The implementation of these framework conditions can be freely designed by people at all levels.

This platform shall contribute to dismantling hierarchical power structures and help end all exploitative structures in society. May humanity, through this and countless other efforts, become a true enrichment to society, nature, and the universe.

## Core Principles

**The Purpose of This Platform:**

This platform exists as a **tool**, not an authority. Its core functions are:

1. **Enable Communication** - People can discuss, share ideas, and exchange knowledge across all scales
2. **Facilitate Decision-Making** - Communities can make collective decisions using various democratic methods
3. **Store & Share Knowledge** - Information remains accessible to all, preserved for future generations
4. **Support Organization** - Groups can coordinate activities, manage projects, and build together

**Fundamental Commitments:**

These principles define what this platform **is** and **is not**. They are designed to ensure the platform remains a liberating tool, never becoming a structure of control:

### 1. Independence & Autonomy

**No External Control**
- No corporate ownership
- No government control
- No individual ownership
- Owned collectively by humanity

**No Profit Motive**
- No advertisements, ever
- No data sales, ever
- No premium features, ever
- No investor influence, ever

**No Hidden Mechanisms**
- All code open source
- All algorithms transparent
- All decisions visible
- All finances public

### 2. Radical Equality

**No Hierarchies of Access**
- Every user has identical capabilities
- No special privileges based on status, wealth, or position
- Learning, working, and scientific groups must always be open
- Knowledge flows freely to all

**No Hierarchies of Knowledge**
- All information equally accessible (except private group content)
- No algorithmic manipulation of visibility
- Users control their own filters and sorting
- Platform does not decide what people see

**No Hierarchies of Power**
- Platform governance by community, not administrators
- Moderation by affected communities, not central authority
- Each group self-governing within framework
- Creator responsibility, not platform censorship

### 3. Subsidiarity in Practice

**Decisions at Smallest Scale**
- Inner circles decide first, choose whether to escalate
- Tools provided for coordination, not requirements
- Local groups control their own structures
- Platform suggests, never mandates

**Scope of Decision-Making**

The platform recognizes these circles of organization:
```
Individual (workspace, home)
  ↓
Small Group (family, coworkers, building residents)
  ↓
Complex (building cluster, factory, neighborhood)
  ↓
Village / Local Community
  ↓
City / Community Cluster
  ↓
Canton / State / Province
  ↓
Country
  ↓
Continental Region
  ↓
Earth
  ↓
[Future: Solar System, Galaxy, Universe...]
```

Each level self-organizes; higher levels exist only for coordination that cannot happen at lower levels.

### 4. Decision Rights by Concern

**Only the Concerned Decide**
- Decisions made by those affected, not representatives
- Regional membership automatic (based on residence)
- Interest-group membership by active participation
- No voting on matters that don't concern you

**Task-Specific Coordination (Not Representation)**

When coordination between communities is needed:
- Communities send interested people for **specific tasks** (not general representation)
- These people create **suggestions**, never final decisions
- Multiple groups can create **competing suggestions**
- **All concerned communities vote** on which suggestion to implement
- Coordination ends when task is complete
- Communities can recall their delegates anytime

*Example: Three villages need a bridge. Each sends interested engineers and residents. These groups separately design bridge proposals. All three villages vote on which design to build. Once built, coordination ends.*

This is **not representation** - it is **collaborative suggestion-making with direct democratic decision**.

### 5. Ecological Responsibility

**Resource Efficiency**
- Lightweight code, minimal bandwidth
- Works on old devices, slow connections
- Scalable architecture to avoid waste
- Continuous optimization for efficiency

**Sustainable Infrastructure**
- Minimal server requirements
- Move toward renewable-powered infrastructure
- Decentralized architecture (reduces single points of resource concentration)
- Long-term thinking in all design decisions

**Transparency of Impact**
- Platform's own resource consumption visible
- Carbon footprint calculated and published
- Community input on sustainability improvements

### 6. Adaptation & Evolution

**Living Platform**
- Community continuously improves features
- Democratic process for platform changes
- Technology evolves with community needs
- No permanent bureaucracy

**Protected Core**
- These Core Principles lock at v1.0
- Can be **clarified**, never **weakened**
- Constitutional amendments require 50% of all eligible voters
- Framework protects against mission drift

## Governance Model

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Current → 1,000 active users)

**Purpose:** Build functional MVP, establish community, refine Core Principles

**Structure:**
- **Technical Administration:** Founding team maintains infrastructure
- **Moderation:** Creator-responsibility model (see below)
- **Platform Decisions:** 
  - Minor: Founding team implements with community input
  - Major: Community vote (binding)
- **Constitutional Refinement:** Core Principles can still be improved

**Transition Trigger:** 1,000 active users OR community votes to move to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Democratic Transition (1,000 → 10,000 users)

**Purpose:** Establish democratic governance structures, expand globally

**Structure:**
- **Platform Coordination Groups:** 
  - Task-specific groups for platform development (not representatives)
  - Groups create competing proposals for features/changes
  - Community votes on proposals
  - No permanent "council" - only task-specific coordination
  
- **Community Voting:**
  - All major decisions require community approval
  - Constitutional amendments locked (require 50% of all voters)
  - Feature priorities decided democratically
  
- **Regional Participation:**
  - Active communities from diverse regions
  - Translation teams as task groups
  - Cultural adaptation by local communities
  
- **Transparent Finances:**
  - All income and expenses publicly visible
  - Budget allocation voted on
  - Reserve fund for resilience

**Transition Trigger:** 10,000 active users OR community votes to move to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Full Decentralization (10,000+ users)

**Purpose:** Transition to fully distributed, community-owned infrastructure

**Structure:**
- **Federation:** Multiple servers, community-operated
- **Distributed Governance:** Each node self-governing within constitution
- **Protocol-Based:** Platform as protocol, not single entity
- **DAO Foundation:** Decentralized autonomous organization
- **Humanity Ownership:** Legal structure makes platform unownable by individuals

**Ongoing:** Continuous improvement by global community

---

## Group Architecture

### Regional Groups (Automatic Membership)

**Automatic Membership Based on Primary Residence:**
- Living address determines regional group membership
- Full rights: discuss, suggest, vote on local matters
- Membership updates with address change
- Travelers: Communities decide how to handle case-by-case

**Scope of Regional Groups:**
- Follow the circles defined in Core Principles (Individual → Small Group → Village → City → etc.)
- Each level coordinates what cannot be done at lower level
- Higher levels exist to serve lower levels, not control them

**Moderation:**
- Default: All members are moderators (democratic moderation)
- Customizable: Community can vote for different structure (e.g., task-specific moderation groups)
- All moderation decisions logged and appealable

**Key Principle:**
- Regional groups cannot be hidden
- Activities affecting community resources must be transparent
- Democratic accountability required for public decisions

### Interest Groups (Active Membership)

**Application-Based Membership:**
- Users apply to join
- Group decides acceptance based on stated criteria
- Clear membership requirements prevent arbitrary exclusion

#### Must Always Be Open (Equal Knowledge Access):

**Learning Groups**
- Educational communities
- Skill-sharing circles
- Study groups
- Any group focused on learning

**Working Groups (Economic Production)**
- Cooperative enterprises
- Production coordination
- Economic planning
- Resource management

**Specialized/Scientific Groups**
- Research communities
- Expert knowledge development
- Scientific collaboration
- Technical advancement

**Reason:** Gemeinschaftlichkeit (Collectivity) - equal access to knowledge and economic participation is fundamental.

#### May Be Closed (Application Required):

**Hobby Groups**
- Sports teams, creative arts, recreational activities
- Can set membership criteria (skill level, commitment, etc.)

**Project Groups**
- Task-specific teams
- Can limit size for coordination efficiency

**Private Groups**
- Personal networks
- Social circles
- Support groups

**Trusts/Associations**
- Formal organizations
- Legal entities
- Membership-based groups

**Membership Process:**
- Creator sets clear criteria for membership
- Criteria must be objective and stated publicly (for open groups)
- Applicants request to join
- Group decides based on stated criteria (not arbitrary)

#### May Be Hidden/Encrypted:

**Same categories as "May Be Closed" can choose encryption**

**Visibility:**
- Group name visible
- Vague location (country-level)
- Purpose/type visible

**Invisible:**
- Member list
- Content
- Discussions
- Activities

**Critical Restriction:**
- Hidden groups **cannot coordinate community resources**
- Hidden groups **cannot make decisions affecting non-members**
- If hidden group conspires against community welfare: legal matter (in severe, clear cases)

**Reason for Allowing Hidden Groups:**
- Protection against current power structures
- Safe spaces for vulnerable people
- Privacy for personal matters
- Freedom of association

**Rule:** Private discussion = can be hidden. Public coordination = must be open.

### Pure Chat Groups

**Fully Invisible Option:**
- Can be completely invisible (no public record)
- No structured features (calendars, files, voting, projects)
- WhatsApp/Telegram-like functionality
- Designed for informal, personal communication

**Limitation:**
- Cannot be used for organizing community decisions
- Cannot link to public resources or projects
- Pure private communication only

---

## Moderation Philosophy

### Creator Responsibility Model

**For Interest Groups:**
- Group creator becomes default moderator
- Can set membership criteria (must be stated publicly for open groups)
- Can remove content violating group guidelines (reason logged publicly)
- Can accept/reject membership applications (closed groups only)
- Can archive group
- Responsibility: Creator liable for group content (within legal frameworks)

**For Regional Groups:**
- No single creator/moderator by default
- All members share moderation responsibility
- Democratic processes for content disputes
- Community can create task-specific moderation groups if needed

### Community Flagging System

**Process:**
1. **Flagging:** Users flag content with reason
2. **Threshold:** X flags → Content hidden behind warning
   - User must click "Show flagged content" to view
   - Warning: "This content has been flagged by community. Reason: [reasons]. View anyway?"
3. **Community Review:** Flagged content visible in community moderation space
4. **Decision:** Community discusses and votes if needed
5. **Transparency:** All flags visible with reasoning
6. **Appeal:** Content creator can appeal, present case to community

**Flag Threshold:**
- Determined by each community (guideline: 5-10 flags or 1% of active members)
- Prevents abuse by single individuals
- Prevents suppression by requiring substantial concern

### Legal Compliance

**Minimum Necessary Enforcement:**
- Only remove content that law requires
- All legal removals logged with specific law citation
- Regional variation acknowledged (different laws in different places)

**Shared Responsibility:**
- Content creator primarily responsible (stated clearly in Terms of Service)
- Platform provides tools, not content control
- Community input on legal boundaries

**Transparency:**
- All content removal visible in public log
- Legal requests published (unless prohibited by law)
- Community advocates for legal reform when laws conflict with principles

---

## Decision-Making & Voting

### Suggestion → Vote Process

**1. Discussion Phase (Optional but Recommended)**
- Discuss topic before creating formal suggestion
- Refine ideas collaboratively
- Build consensus or identify competing approaches
- Platform provides discussion tools

**2. Create Suggestion**
- Any member can create suggestion (within their concerned scope)
- Must clearly state: what, why, who is concerned, expected outcome
- Open for editing by creator

**3. Support Accumulation**
- Community discusses, refines suggestion
- Supporters indicate support
- Threshold: Determined by community (guideline: 5-20% of concerned people)

**4. Lock Point (Default: 30% support)**
- At 30% support, suggestion locks - no more edits
- Prevents bait-and-switch manipulation
- Supporters backed specific text
- Lock threshold customizable by community

**5. Automatic Vote Trigger (100% threshold or time limit)**
- At 100% support OR time limit reached → becomes binding vote
- Multiple competing suggestions can go to vote simultaneously
- Vote types: modular system (see below)

**6. Voting**
- All concerned participate
- Transparency: who voted, how they voted (customizable by community)
- Results published

**7. Implementation**
- Winning suggestion becomes decision
- Community implements (or designated group for task)
- Progress trackable on platform

### Vote Types (Modular System)

**Extensible Framework:** New vote types can be added by community

**Initial Types:**

1. **Simple Yes/No**
   - Single proposal
   - Accept or reject

2. **Multiple Choice**
   - Several competing proposals
   - Choose one
   - Optional: ranked-choice elimination

3. **Budget Allocation**
   - Distribute resources across priorities
   - Each voter has points to allocate
   - Results show community priorities

4. **Consensus-Building (Resistance Measurement)**
   - Rate proposals on scale of resistance/support
   - Find proposal with least resistance
   - Useful when compromise needed

5. **Ranked Choice**
   - Rank proposals in order of preference
   - Instant-runoff elimination
   - Produces majority-supported outcome

6. **Range Voting**
   - Score each option (e.g., 0-10)
   - Highest average score wins
   - Captures nuance of preference strength

### Transparency & Privacy

**Default: Full Transparency**
- Who voted: Public
- How they voted: Public
- Results: Public with full breakdown
- Reason: Prevents fraud, enables independent verification

**Customizable: Secret Ballot**
- Communities can vote to enable secret ballot
- Requires community decision (not default)
- Decision to use secret ballot is itself public
- Used when external coercion is concern

**For New Groups:**
- Open groups: Default transparency
- Closed groups: Creator chooses initial policy
- Policy changes require group vote

### Scope Validation

**Regional Votes:**
- Only residents of concerned region can participate
- Address verification (initially honor system, later API integration)

**Group Votes:**
- Only active members can participate
- Membership visible to group

**Identity Verification:**
- Basic account: Pseudonymous (sufficient for most participation)
- Verified account: Real identity required for:
  - Public regional votes (binding decisions affecting legal matters)
  - Economic coordination in GKW phase
- Future: Government API integration for verification
- Also: Nonprofit organization APIs to break government monopoly on identity

### Amendment Thresholds

**Platform Changes:**
- Minor features: Technical team implements with community input
- Major features: Community vote (simple majority of votes cast)
- Constitutional amendments: 50% of all eligible voters (not just votes cast)

**Rationale for 50% of all voters:**
- Prevents small active minority from overturning fundamental principles
- Constitutional stability requires broad legitimacy
- High threshold appropriate for foundational changes
- OK for lower thresholds in project, economic, or local law decisions

---

## Economic Integration

### Phase 0: Cooperative Network Pilot (Transition Within Capitalism)

**Before GKW Implementation:**

While still in capitalist economic systems, platform supports:

**Cooperative Network:**
- Network of cooperatives using platform for coordination
- Equal wages calculated via regional basket of goods
- Surplus value pooled collectively
- Four principles (sustainability, collectivity, subsidiarity, concerned decision-making) in binding contract

**Principles for Network:**
- Acknowledge job displacement from efficiency
- Work for all humanity, not just network members
- Transparent operations visible on platform
- Gradual expansion as more cooperatives join

**Platform Support:**
- Coordination tools for production/distribution
- Transparent accounting
- Democratic governance within cooperatives
- Resource sharing between cooperatives

### Phase 1+: GKW Integration (Future)

**When Legally Implemented:**

Platform can integrate full Gemeinschaftliche Kontingentwirtschaft features:

**Contingent System Support:**
- Resource contingent tracking (environmental impact calculation)
- Value contingent distribution (equal allocation visualization)
- Budget allocation voting (democratic resource distribution)
- Production coordination (connect needs with capacity)

**Important:**
- GKW is one possible implementation of the framework
- Communities free to develop other economic models within four principles
- Platform remains neutral tool, not enforcer of specific economic system

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Disputes Within Groups

**1. Internal Discussion**
- Group members attempt to resolve directly
- Discussion tools provided
- Mediation spaces available

**2. Mediation**
- Neutral community members facilitate (voluntary mediators)
- Mediators can be found via specialized groups (must work for free - no paid mediation)
- Process documented transparently

**3. Community Vote**
- If resolution fails, concerned community decides
- Democratic process for disputes

**4. Transparency**
- All conflict resolution processes documented publicly
- Precedents visible for learning

**No Paid Mediation:**
- Prevents economy of conflict resolution
- Prevents ads disguised as services
- Maintains platform independence
- Specialized "conflict resolution" groups welcome as volunteer service

### Platform-Level Conflicts

**1. Community Forum**
- Open discussion of platform-level issues
- All users can participate

**2. Task-Specific Coordination Groups**
- If needed, communities send interested people to propose solutions
- Multiple competing proposals created
- No permanent "council" or "authority"

**3. Community Vote**
- Binding decision by active users
- Threshold based on severity (constitutional: 50% of all voters; feature changes: majority of votes cast)

**4. Constitutional Review**
- Check alignment with Core Principles
- Principles themselves cannot be changed (only clarified)

### Constitutional Violations

**Process:**
1. **Raise Concern:** Any user can flag potential violation of Core Principles
2. **Gather Support:** Other users can support concern (like suggestion process)
3. **Public Review:** Community examines claim with evidence
4. **Binding Vote:** If violation confirmed, must be corrected
5. **Implementation:** Changes made to restore alignment

**No Exceptions:** Core Principles are absolute - they define what this platform is.

### Future: Community Accountability System (Phase 3+)

**Long-term Vision (2+ million users):**
- Community-run accountability processes
- Public proceedings for structural problems
- Democratic decision-making on platform-level issues
- Restorative justice approach, not punitive
- Learning from conflicts to improve systems

---

## Legal Structure

### Current Phase: Establishing Foundation

**Entity Type: To Be Determined**

**Options Being Considered:**

1. **Verein (Swiss Association)**
   - Simplest to establish (requires 2+ people, statutes, minutes)
   - Non-profit by default
   - Democratic structure fits philosophy
   - Low bureaucracy
   - ✅ Currently preferred option

2. **Genossenschaft (Swiss Cooperative)**
   - Member-owned
   - Can facilitate economic activity
   - Good for cooperative network phase
   - More formal structure
   - Possible transition from Verein later

3. **Movement (No Legal Entity)**
   - Maximum flexibility
   - No bureaucracy
   - Challenge: Cannot have bank account, sign contracts
   - Personal liability risks
   - Not viable for platform operation

**Current Approach:**
- Operate as grassroots movement initially
- Establish Verein when bank account needed
- Can transition to Genossenschaft if economic network develops
- Can transition to DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) in Phase 3

**Jurisdiction:** Switzerland (initially)

**Liability:** Creator responsibility model (see Moderation Philosophy)

**Compliance:** Swiss data protection law, GDPR (European users)

### Future Structure: Humanity Ownership

**Goal:** Platform owned collectively by humanity (all sentient beings)

**Mechanism:**
- Transition to DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
- Custom license: "Held in trust for all sentient beings"
- Perpetual Trust structure (Swiss law)
- No individual or corporate ownership possible

**License Being Developed:**
Based on AGPL v3 with additional preamble:

```
"This work is held in perpetual trust for all sentient beings,
present and future, biological and synthetic,
terrestrial and extraterrestrial.

No individual, corporation, government, or other entity
may claim exclusive ownership or control.

This work exists to serve the free development of all beings
in harmony with nature and universal principles.

Any use that creates hierarchies, exploitation, or harm
violates the spirit of this license and is prohibited."
```

**Legal Review Needed:** Community lawyers to refine license text.

## Funding & Sustainability

### Absolute Prohibitions

These funding sources are **permanently banned:**

1. **No Advertisements** - Ever. Platform dies before ads appear.
2. **No Data Sales** - Ever. User data is not a commodity.
3. **No Premium Features** - Ever. Equality of access is fundamental.
4. **No Investor Control** - Ever. Community governs, not capital.

### Permitted Funding Sources

**1. Community Donations**
- Voluntary contributions from users
- Transparent accounting of all donations
- No donor influence on platform decisions
- Donations support infrastructure only

**2. Grants**
- Foundations supporting democratic infrastructure
- NGOs aligned with platform principles
- Must not compromise independence
- All grant relationships publicly disclosed

**3. Cooperative Network Surplus (Future)**
- If cooperative network generates surplus
- Surplus can fund platform development
- Transparent allocation
- Democratic decision on usage

### Spending Principles

**All Platform Expenditures Must Follow These Rules:**

1. **Equal Wages:**
   - Any paid work (rare, only necessities) pays equal hourly rate
   - Rate calculated via average basket of goods for region/currency
   - No wage hierarchies, no bonuses, no special compensation

2. **Environmental Priority:**
   - Always choose most sustainable option
   - Renewable energy preferred
   - Minimal resource consumption
   - Long-term thinking over short-term savings

3. **Cooperative Preference:**
   - Prefer cooperatives following same guidelines
   - Support aligned economic structures
   - Build solidarity economy
   - Transparent supply chains

4. **Necessity Only:**
   - Only purchase absolute necessities
   - Servers (until community-owned infrastructure)
   - Security services (if no volunteers available)
   - Legal compliance costs
   - Electricity, hardware (essential operations)

### Volunteer-First Principle

**Platform Work is Always Voluntary:**
- All development is volunteer contribution
- All moderation is volunteer service
- All translation is volunteer effort
- All community support is volunteer labor

**Exception - External Use:**
- If government uses platform for elections and pays vote counters: permitted
- If organization uses platform and has paid staff: permitted
- Platform itself does not pay these workers
- External entities can compensate their own staff for platform-related work

**Why Volunteer-Only:**
- Platform seeks to transcend money-based systems
- Paid labor creates hierarchies
- Community ownership means community labor
- Models the gift economy we're building toward

### Budget Transparency

**Public Financial Dashboard:**
- All income sources and amounts
- All expenditures with receipts
- Current balance and reserve fund
- Projections for sustainability
- Updated continuously

**Community Input:**
- Budget decisions voted on
- Reserve fund size determined by community
- Emergency spending requires community approval
- Annual financial review by community

- Hierarchies of power are replaced by circles of collaboration

**Not Just For Us:**

This is infrastructure for humanity's transition toward:

- **Liberation from exploitation** - No more systems that enrich few at cost of many
- **Harmony with nature** - Living within ecological limits with respect
- **Collective flourishing** - Rising together, not climbing over each other
- **Respect for higher principles** - Aligning with universal truths we're still discovering

**Humility & Imperfection:**

We build this knowing:
- We will make mistakes - the community will correct them
- Future generations will improve our work - we welcome this
- We cannot predict all needs - flexibility is designed in
- Principles matter more than specific implementations

**Encoding Against Corruption:**

We encode these principles deeply into code, governance, and culture, so that:
- No individual can corrupt this tool for personal power
- No corporation can extract value from human connection
- No government can use this for surveillance or control
- No ideology can suppress open dialogue

**The Platform is Not Ours:**

It belongs to all humanity, present and future.  
It belongs to all beings who may one day use it.  
It belongs to the children not yet born.  
It belongs to species not yet evolved or contacted.

We are merely the first caretakers.

## Endorsement & Evolution

### Founding Vision

**Initiator:** Stefan Hubschmid (Names don't matter - the people who fill things with life do!)

**Contact:** info@visionaere-bewegung.org

**Founding Principle:** This work belongs to all. Personality cults are rejected. The platform's success is measured by how many people it empowers, not by who built it.

### Community Endorsement Process

**How to Endorse This Constitution:**

1. Read and understand the Core Principles
2. Confirm alignment with your values
3. Submit endorsement via platform (once operational)
4. Public record shows growing legitimacy

**Endorsement Means:**
- "I support these Core Principles"
- "I will help build/maintain this platform"
- "I commit to using this tool for liberation, not domination"

**Growing Record:**
- Version 0.1: Initial draft (December 24, 2025)
- Version 0.2: Major refinement (December 25, 2025)
- Version 1.0: First public release (date TBD)
- [Future versions as community refines]

**Community Input:**
- Discussion forum for constitutional questions
- Suggestion process for improvements
- Vote on amendments (50% of all voters required)
- Regular review cycles

## Appendix A: Definitions

**Concerned (Die Betroffenen):** Those affected by a decision and therefore having the right to participate in making it. Geographic or interest-based scope determines who is concerned.

**Subsidiarity (Subsidiarität):** Principle that decisions should be made at the smallest competent level, with inner circles choosing whether to escalate to larger circles for coordination.

**Gemeinschaftlichkeit (Collectivity):** Equal access to resources, knowledge, and decision-making. Collaborative development. No hierarchies of privilege.

**Würdevolle Nachhaltigkeit (Dignified Sustainability):** Ecological balance with respect for all life. Living within regenerative capacity of nature while maintaining human dignity and freedom.

**GKW (Gemeinschaftliche Kontingentwirtschaft):** Collaborative contingent economy - one possible implementation of the four principles in economic organization, based on resource democracy and sustainability limits.

**Hidden Group:** Group visible by name and vague location, but with encrypted content and member list. Used for protection, not for coordinating community resources.

**Regional Group:** Geographic group based on residence, with automatic membership. Follows scope circles from individual to global levels.

**Interest Group:** Topic-based group requiring active membership application. Can be open (must accept all), closed (selective), or hidden (encrypted).

**Task-Specific Coordination:** When communities send interested people to work on specific tasks (like designing a bridge), creating suggestions but never making final decisions. Not representation - collaborative suggestion-making with democratic decision.

**Creator Responsibility:** Model where content creators are responsible for their posts, and group creators are default moderators. Shifts responsibility from central platform to actual participants.

**Transparent Moderation:** All content removal, flags, and moderation actions logged publicly with reasons. Community can review and appeal.

**Volunteer-First Principle:** Platform work is unpaid community contribution. External organizations can pay their own staff, but platform itself operates on gift economy model.

**50% of All Voters:** Constitutional amendment threshold - requires half of all eligible voters to approve (not just half of votes cast), ensuring broad legitimacy for foundational changes.

## Appendix C: Comparison with Other Platforms

**How This Differs from Existing Tools:**

| Platform | Ownership | Profit Motive | Transparency | Governance | Our Difference |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Facebook/Meta | Corporate | Ads, data sales | Opaque algorithms | Corporate board | Community-owned, no profit, open source |
| Reddit | Corporate (public) | Ads, premium features | Some transparency | Corporate + limited community | Fully democratic, no ads ever |
| Mastodon | Federated | Donations | Open source | Server-level | Global coordination + federation |
| Discord | Corporate | Freemium model | Closed source | Corporate | Open source, no premium tiers |
| Slack | Corporate | Subscription | Closed source | Corporate | Free, community-governed |
| Wikipedia | Foundation | Donations | Very transparent | Foundation + community | More democratic tools + organization |
| Loomio | Cooperative | Subscription | Open source | Cooperative | Broader scope, no subscription |

**Our Unique Combination:**

- Democratic governance from day one
- No profit motive ever
- Complete transparency (code, finances, decisions)
- Four-principle framework prevents mission drift
- Tools for organization + decision-making + knowledge + communication
- Scales from individual to global
- Designed for economic transition (GKW-compatible)
- Humanity ownership (not just open source)

## Notes for Development Team

**Constitutional Status:**
- Version 0.2 is draft for internal review
- Accepting comments and revisions
- Target v1.0 for first public release
- After v1.0, Core Principles become immutable (only clarifications allowed)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review v0.2 with founding team
2. Create technical architecture document
3. Design entity-relationship diagram (database schema)
4. Write user stories and use cases
5. Develop MVP roadmap with milestones
6. Begin coding when architecture finalized

**Philosophy Check:**
Before any major decision, ask:
- Does this serve free human development?
- Does this maintain equality of access?
- Does this support subsidiarity?
- Does this enable concerned to decide?
- Does this avoid hierarchies of power?

If answer to any is "no," reconsider the approach.

**Remember:**
We are building infrastructure for human liberation. This is sacred work. Approach with humility, care, and long-term thinking. The children of 2100 should thank us for building something that served their great-grandparents and still serves them.
