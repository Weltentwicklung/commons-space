## Core Vision

Platform as **tool for human development**, not a prescriptive system.

**Key principle:** Always enable, never enforce.

---

## 4 Core Principles

### 1. Dignified Sustainability
- Humanity must not destroy more than surroundings can regenerate
- Nature is not merely an object serving us
- Must see bigger connections

### 2. Equality
- Equal access to resources
- Equal access to means of self-organization
- No inequality in power

### 3. Decision by the Concerned
- Only affected parties participate in decisions
- Not "interested parties" - only "concerned parties"
- Those impacted by outcome make the decision

### 4. Subsidiarity
- Decisions at smallest competent level
- Inner circles do things themselves first
- Ask bigger circles for help only when needed
- Interaction initiated by request of smaller circle

## Evolutionary States

**Not fixed systems, but evolutionary states:**

- **Dictatorship/Indirect Democracy:** Stuck states (don't enable evolution)
- **Direct Democracy/GKW:** Growth states (enable evolution toward awareness)
- **Anarchy:** Edge state (maximum evolution, can fall back if needed)

**Dynamic equilibrium:**
```
Edge State (Anarchy) ⟷ Fallback Systems (GKW) ⟷ Edge State
```

---

## Anarchism as Edge State

**Not an endpoint, but an edge state:**
- Most evolved form of organization
- Starting point for true development (cultural, spiritual, individual)
- Can fall back to temporary structures when needed

**Before edge state:**
- Energy on power struggles, resource fights, survival
- Stuck solving structural problems

**After edge state:**
- Structural problems solved
- Energy freed for evolution beyond current imagination

---

## GKW as Fallback

**Gemeinschaftliche Kontingentwirtschaft (GKW):**
- Collaborative Contingent Economy
- Temporary fallback when awareness insufficient
- NOT the goal - one possible implementation

**Mechanism:**
1. Measure sustainability by awareness + data
2. Anarchic self-regulation fails → activate temporary structure
3. Provide structure (e.g., contingent distribution)
4. Monitor if still needed
5. Dissolve when awareness sufficient

**This shatters permanent hierarchy justification:**
> Traditional: "Problem → Hierarchy → Never leaves"  
> GKW: "Problem → Temporary structure → Dissolves"

---

## Awareness as Core Mechanism

**No structure needed except measure sustainability by awareness.**

**When awareness sufficient:** Self-regulation, no imposed structures  
**When awareness insufficient:** Fall back to temporary systems

---

## Decision-Making Principles

### Subsidiarity vs. Decisions by Concerned

**Different principles:**
- **Subsidiarity:** Inner circle decides, reaches out if needed
- **Decisions by Concerned:** ALL affected decide together

**Not the same thing.** Both apply but in different contexts.

### No Permanent Representatives

- Task-specific delegation allowed (temporary, specific purpose)
- No permanent "representatives" making decisions for others
- No one builds career/status through delegation

---

## Anti-Institutionalization Design

### Temporary Structures Only

**When needed:**
- Conflict resolution
- Crisis response
- Specific tasks

**Must dissolve after completion:**
- No permanent roles
- No one builds livelihood around position
- Prevents power structures forming

**Example: Village crisis**
1. Recognize emotional compromise
2. Call objective mediators from neighboring communities
3. Temporary structure created
4. Decision made
5. Structure dissolved

### No Personality Cult

**Contributor System:**
- Simple integer IDs (1, 2, 3)
- Full transparency (names available but not emphasized)
- Focus on contributions, not contributors
- No reputation building through platform

---

## Transparency Rules

### Organizations Cannot Hide Contributors

**Wrong:** Organization as single entity, members hidden  
**Right:** All team members visible as individual persons

**Rationale:** Full transparency, no hiding behind organizational identity

### Hidden Groups: Allowed BUT Restricted

**Allowed because:**
- Activism against unjust power requires protection
- Whistleblowers need safety
- Persecuted minorities need secure spaces

**Restricted because:**
- Cannot coordinate community-wide resources
- Cannot make decisions affecting non-members
- Those affected deserve to know who decides

**Balance:** Safety vs. accountability

---

## Platform Role

### What Platform IS:

- Communication tool across distances
- Collective decision-making facilitator
- Knowledge storage
- Self-organization support

**Characteristics:**
- Independent, non-hierarchical
- Volunteer-run (no earning through platform)
- Transparent operations
- Collectively owned

### What Platform IS NOT:

- Authority making decisions
- Profit-making entity
- Power structure
- Prescriptive system

---

## Economic Model

### Platform Itself

**Volunteer principle:**
- All development/maintenance volunteer work
- No one earns money through platform
- Prevents conflicting interests

**Necessary purchases only:**
- Servers, hardware, security (when no volunteer alternative)
- Follow principles: equal wages, environmental, cooperative preference
- "Try to follow when possible" (pragmatic)

**External use allowed:**
- Governments/organizations may use platform
- They pay their own staff
- Platform remains free for individuals

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Neurodiversity as Resource

**Example: Psychopaths as objective judges**
- Reduced mirror neurons = less emotional contagion
- Can remain objective during emotional crises
- Western view: "dangerous" → Evolved view: "valuable resource"
- Requires ethical framework and logic training

**Principle:** Utilize diverse human capacities appropriately

---

## Scope Circles

**Nested organizational levels:**
1. Individual & Small Groups
2. Local Community (automatic membership by residence)
3. Voluntary Groups (hobby, project, learning, specialist)
4. Municipal/Town Level
5. Regional Level
6. National/Global Level

**Decisions flow:** Smallest competent level first

---

## Group Types

### Transparent Groups
- Visible membership and activities
- Can coordinate community resources
- Can make decisions about society -> all affected have to be included

### Hidden/Encrypted Groups
- Allowed for safety and privacy
- **Cannot** coordinate community resources
- **Cannot** make decisions affecting outsiders
- Necessary to fight power structures and to have privacy

---

## Implementation Philosophy

### Platform Provides Tools, Not Rules

- Encourages best practices
- Does NOT enforce
- Makes transparency easier, not mandatory
- Respects autonomy while supporting accountability

### The Classic Dilemma

**Problem:** Capitalism enables abuse of platform for profit/status

**Wrong response:** Ban, restrict, moderate, create control mechanisms

**Right response:**
- Point it out as equal user
- Start discussions with concerned parties
- Make suggestions, start votings
- Vote "by feet" (don't pay for promoted things)

**If we think we need to control everything → we already failed.**

**Lesson:** Wisdom comes through calm and happiness, not anger and frustration.

### Pragmatic Language

- "Try to follow when possible" > absolute requirements
- Acknowledges constraints
- Maintains principles while allowing flexibility

---

## Platform in Evolved State

**Even in anarchic edge state, platform remains necessary:**
- Communication across distance
- Knowledge storage (collective memory)
- Severe event response
- Temporary structure coordination

**No structure ≠ No tools:**
- Herrschaftsfrei (no domination) ≠ No organization
- Communication tools essential
- Temporary structures acceptable when needed
- Default: NO structures, only in severe necessity

---

## Key Implementation Rules

1. **No hierarchy** - Ever
2. **Full transparency** - Except when safety requires privacy or in private groups not concerned with society issues
3. **Volunteer only** - No earning through platform
4. **Temporary structures** - Must dissolve after purpose fulfilled
5. **Decisions by concerned** - Only affected parties participate
6. **Subsidiarity** - Smallest level first
7. **Enable, don't enforce** - Tools, not rules
8. **No personality cult** - Focus on contributions, not contributors
