# Contributors System

**Purpose:** This document explains how we track contributions while preventing personality cults.

**Current tracking files:**
- [sessions_v0.1.md](sessions_v0.1.md) - Session information
- [contributors_v0.1.md](contributors_v0.1.md) - Contributor information

**Note:** These are temporary manual files. The SQL tables will be located in `/src/database/schema.sql` when the database becomes operational.

## Philosophy: Contributions Over Contributors

This project focuses on **what was contributed**, not **who contributed it**.

**Why?**

**Problems with personality-focused systems:**
- Personality cults lead to worship and idealization of individuals
- Supports hierarchical structures and unequal evaluation
- Reduces ability to concentrate on content and ideas
- Encourages focus on people instead of substance
- Reduces self-reflection and openness to criticism
- Reduces accountability due to goodwill toward famous people

**Our approach:**
- Track contributions transparently
- Use numeric IDs in documentation
- No "founder" or "core team" designations
- No special status for early contributors
- Equal evaluation of all contributions

**Balance:**
- **Complete transparency:** Full contributor information available
- **Personal appreciation:** Valued on direct, human level
- **No societal hierarchy:** Excluded from society-level recognition

### Appreciation Philosophy

> "Appreciation of people is an important part of human life, but it should be done on a personal level and excluded from society-level projects. Appreciating people directly helps them feel valued without overwhelming them, and provides motivation and inspiration."

## Current System (Phase 1: Creation)

**How to contribute:**

Contact: info@visionaere-bewegung.org  
Subject: Contribution to commons-space

We're building the foundation based on core principles stated in the constitution.

**Future phases:** Will be clarified as the project grows.

## Contribution Types

Contributors can help with:

- **Design:** Architecture, UI/UX, system design
- **Development:** Backend, frontend, database
- **Documentation:** Writing, editing, translating
- **Testing:** Bug reports, feature testing, user feedback
- **Philosophy:** Constitutional refinement, principle clarification
- **Community:** Helping others, answering questions, onboarding

## No Contributor Roles

**Important:** This project does not use "contributor roles."

**Why not?**
- Even descriptive roles can produce subconscious evaluations
- Roles create implicit hierarchies ("Initiator" vs "Contributor")
- Contributions speak for themselves without labels

**What we track instead:**
- Contribution topics (design, code, documentation, etc.)
- Specific contributions per session
- No ranking, no status, no roles

**Note:** If "contributor roles" are common in other projects, we acknowledge this but choose a different approach aligned with our anti-hierarchy principles.

## Recognition Without Hierarchy

**What we do:**
- ✅ Track all contributions in database
- ✅ Show who participated in what
- ✅ Make information searchable
- ✅ Preserve contribution history transparently

**What we don't do:**
- ❌ Create "core team" vs "contributors" distinction
- ❌ Award badges, karma, or reputation points
- ❌ Rank contributors by "importance"
- ❌ Give special status to early contributors  
- ❌ Use contributions as social currency
- ❌ Credit "collective effort" (this would still credit something; contributions are free gifts to humanity)

**Why:** Prevents institutionalization and status hierarchies that would undermine platform values.

## Volunteer Principles

All contributors agree to:

1. **Volunteer Work:** No payment for platform development
2. **Collective Ownership:** Work belongs to the commons
3. **Transparency:** All work visible and documented
4. **No Status Building:** Don't use platform for reputation/career
5. **Anti-Institutionalization:** Resist permanent roles
6. **Ideas Over Identity:** Focus on what, not who

**Why these principles?**

They prevent the platform from becoming a vehicle for personal advancement, which would create conflicting interests (incentive to maintain unnecessary structures).

## Future System (When Database Operational)

A comprehensive contribution tracking system will be created with:

**Key components:**
- Normalized SQL tables for contributors, sessions, contributions
- Separate tracking for persons vs entities (organizations, AI)
- Detailed contribution types and topics
- Contact information management
- Contribution guidelines document

**Development priorities:**
1. Create contributor_guidelines.md
2. Design normalized database schema
3. Implement contribution tracking
4. Build web interface for viewing contributions
5. Establish contribution workflows

**This is on our to-do list** for when the platform becomes operational.

**Remember:** This system tracks contributions, not contributors. The focus is on what was created for the commons, not who created it.
