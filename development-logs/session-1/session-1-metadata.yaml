# Key Decisions Made
key_decisions:
  - decision: "Project named 'commons-space'"
    rationale: "Holistic, non-prescriptive, works across all evolutionary states"
    
  - decision: "Constitution v0.1 established"
    rationale: "Foundation document with core principles"
    
  - decision: "Two-tier documentation system"
    rationale: "Raw transcripts for transparency, protocols for usability"
    
  - decision: "Simple integer Contributor IDs (1, 2, 3...)"
    rationale: "Clean database design, infinite scalability, prevents personality cult"
    
  - decision: "SESSION-[ID] naming without contributor names"
    rationale: "Avoids hierarchy suggestion, collaborative sessions"
    
  - decision: "Always include version numbers in filenames"
    rationale: "No renaming needed, easy archiving, clear history"
    
  - decision: "Organizations NOT entities - all persons visible"
    rationale: "Full transparency, no hiding behind organizational identity"
    
  - decision: "Archive pattern for versioning"
    rationale: "Clean main folders, old versions in /archive subdirectories"

# Major Insights
insights:
  - "Anarchism is an 'edge state' not an 'endpoint'"
  - "GKW serves as fallback mechanism to prevent system collapse"
  - "Platform is tool for human development, not prescriptive system"
  - "Subsidiarity ≠ Decisions by Concerned (distinct principles)"
  - "Hidden groups allowed for safety but cannot coordinate community resources"
  - "Temporary structures dissolve after crisis (prevent institutionalization)"
  - "Psychopaths as objective judges during emotional crises (neurodiversity as resource)"
  - "Platform must never enable livelihood-building or reputation (prevents conflicting interests)"

# Technical Decisions
technical:
  - "Database normalization: persons/entities/contributors/sessions separate tables"
  - "One person = one contributor_id (one-to-one)"
  - "One entity = multiple contributor_ids (one-to-many)"
  - "YAML metadata files for machine readability"
  - "Markdown protocols for human readability"
  - "Git for version control, /archive for easy access to old versions"

# Open Questions
open_questions:
  - "Technology stack (C++ vs community-friendly alternatives)"
  - "Entity-Relationship Diagram (detailed database design)"
  - "Weltentwicklung License finalization"
  - "Legal entity formation (Verein structure)"

# Next Session Topics
next_session:
  - "License refinement and finalization"
  - "Technical architecture decisions"
  - "Database schema design"
  - "README.md creation"
  - "Missing documentation completion"

# Notes
notes: |
  This session established the complete philosophical and organizational 
  foundation for commons-space. It represents the transition from initial 
  concept to concrete constitutional framework and documentation system.
  
  The session was conducted asynchronously over 5 days between a human 
  contributor (Stefan) and an AI assistant (Claude), with full transparency 
  about the AI's role in co-creation.
  
  All major architectural decisions for the project were made during this 
  session, including the anti-personality-cult contributor system and the 
  two-tier documentation approach.
