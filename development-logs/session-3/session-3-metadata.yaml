# Key Decisions Made
key_decisions:
  - decision: "Use claude.ai Projects feature for chat management"
    rationale: "Session-based chats within project, shared knowledge base, most resource-efficient"
    
  - decision: "Separate /foundation/ and /ai-instructions/ folders"
    rationale: "Clear distinction: human-readable inspiration vs AI working reference"
    
  - decision: "Keep implementation details in philosophical-instructions.md"
    rationale: "Perfect for AI reference, removes clutter from human philosophical document"
    
  - decision: "Personal preferences stay local to stefan's project"
    rationale: "Avoid personality cult, universal instructions for all contributors"
    
  - decision: "Always use lowercase for stefan's name"
    rationale: "stefan's personal preference"

# Major Insights
insights:
  - "Projects feature solves chat limit problem elegantly"
  - "Human vs AI documents serve different purposes - both needed"
  - "Philosophical foundation works better as inspiration than technical spec"
  - "Awareness as core mechanism is central to philosophy"
  - "Implementation details belong with AI instructions, not philosophical foundation"

# Notes
notes: |
  Session 3 focused on establishing proper project organization using claude.ai 
  Projects feature. Major achievement was creating clear separation between 
  human-readable foundation documents (inspirational, philosophical) and AI 
  working instructions (practical, implementation-focused).
  
  stefan's extensive rewrite of philosophical-foundation.md transformed it 
  from technical documentation into inspirational vision with soul and wisdom.
