# Session 3 Protocol: Project Setup & Instruction Files

**Session ID:** 3  
**Date:** January 3-4, 2025  
**Contributors:** 1, 2

---

## Executive Summary

Session 3 established proper project organization using claude.ai Projects feature. We created comprehensive instruction files for AI assistants, refined folder structure with clear separation between human-readable foundation documents and AI working references, and transformed the philosophical foundation from technical documentation into inspirational vision.

## 1. Chat Strategy - Projects Feature

We addressed the problem of chat token limits and decided to use claude.ai Projects feature.

**Decision:**
- Create commons-space project in claude.ai
- Session-based chats within project
- Shared knowledge base across all chats
- Most resource-efficient approach

**Benefits:**
- No more chat limit issues
- Consistent context across sessions
- Natural alignment with session structure
- Easy collaboration

## 2. Folder Structure Refinement

Created clear separation between different document types.

**New structure:**
```
/docs/
  /foundation/              # Human-readable: inspiration, philosophy
  /ai-instructions/         # AI reference: practical, implementation
  /guides/                  # User documentation
  /license/
```

**Rationale:**
- Foundation documents for humans (why we do this)
- AI instructions for assistants (how to work)
- Clear purpose, better organization
- Fewer folders in /docs/ → better overview

---

## 3. Instruction Files Created

Created 4 core instruction files for AI assistants working on project.

**Files:**
- `general-instructions.md` - Universal working principles
- `philosophical-instructions.md` - Philosophy condensed for AI
- `session-documentation-guide.md` - How to create session files
- `repository-structure.md` - Navigation guide

**Key principle:** Universal instructions in GitHub, personal preferences in local project settings only.

## 4. Philosophical Foundation Transformation

stefan extensively rewrote philosophical-foundation.md, transforming it from technical documentation into inspirational vision with soul and wisdom.

**Changes:**
- From architectural paper → inspirational philosophy
- Added emphasis on earth being rich, humans being capable
- Expanded on hierarchy critique
- Added "The Classic Dilemma" section (capitalism abuse)
- Integrated awareness as core mechanism
- Removed implementation details (moved to AI instructions)

**Result:** Human-readable document that inspires rather than instructs.

---

## 5. Implementation Details → AI Instructions

Created philosophical-instructions.md containing all implementation details from original philosophical foundation.

**Contains:**
- Decision-making principles
- Anti-institutionalization design
- Transparency rules
- Conflict resolution
- Scope circles
- Group types
- Implementation philosophy

**Purpose:** Quick AI reference without overwhelming human readers.

---

## 6. Universal vs Personal Preferences

Separated universal project principles from stefan's personal working preferences.

**Universal (GitHub):**
- Project principles
- How to load files
- Session documentation
- Naming conventions

**Personal (stefan's local project only):**
- Ask before starting
- Don't suggest tasks
- Don't make compliments
- Always lowercase: stefan

**Rationale:** Avoid personality cult, even in small details.

---

## 7. Awareness Integration

Integrated key discussion from Session 1 about awareness as core mechanism.

**Core concept:**
> "No structure needed except measure sustainability by awareness"

**Dynamic equilibrium:**
- Awareness sufficient → self-regulation, no structures
- Awareness insufficient → temporary fallback (GKW)
- Structure dissolves when awareness returns

**This is the revolutionary insight** that shatters permanent hierarchy justification.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use claude.ai Projects | Session-based chats, shared knowledge, resource-efficient |
| Separate /foundation/ and /ai-instructions/ | Human inspiration vs AI practical reference |
| Keep implementation details in AI instructions | Removes clutter from philosophical foundation |
| Personal preferences local only | Avoid personality cult |
| Always lowercase: stefan | Personal preference |

## Next Session Topics

1. Additional context documents for project
2. File refinements based on stefan's changes
3. Continue project setup within claude.ai Projects
