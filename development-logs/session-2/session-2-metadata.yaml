# Key Decisions Made
key_decisions:
  - decision: "Always use version numbers in filenames"
    rationale: "No renaming needed when creating new versions, clearer history, easier archiving"
    
  - decision: "Use lowercase for all filenames"
    rationale: "Single consistent naming strategy, Unix-friendly"
    
  - decision: "Contributor IDs without 'Contributor-' prefix in most contexts"
    rationale: "Matches database value, less redundant, clearer"
    
  - decision: "Organizations NOT entities - must show all individual contributors"
    rationale: "Full transparency, prevents hiding behind organizational identity"
    
  - decision: "One person = one contributor_id (strict one-to-one)"
    rationale: "Clarity, prevents confusion through multiple identities"
    
  - decision: "One entity = multiple contributor_ids (one-to-many)"
    rationale: "AI can be used by different persons in different contexts"
    
  - decision: "Separate YAML metadata + Protocol for each session"
    rationale: "YAML for machines, Protocol for humans, both serve different purposes"
    
  - decision: "Reorganize into /database/ and /docs/guides/ folders"
    rationale: "Clean main folder, logical separation of data vs documentation"

# Major Insights
insights:
  - "Version numbers in filenames eliminate renaming workflow"
  - "Organizations as entities would enable hiding contributors - violates transparency"
  - "Metadata serves machines (automation), protocols serve humans (understanding)"
  - "Simple naming (lowercase, no prefixes) reduces cognitive load"
  - "Git relative paths simpler than full paths"
  - "Archive pattern keeps main folders clean while preserving history"

# Technical Decisions
technical:
  - "Git workflow: commit -F for message files, relative paths"
  - "Branch standardization: main (not master)"
  - "Archive pattern: /archive/ subfolders in each directory"
  - "README.md in each folder points to current version"
  - "Database files in /database/ (temporary until SQL migration)"
  - "Documentation in /docs/guides/ (friendly, extensible)"

# Naming Conventions Established
conventions:
  filenames: "lowercase-with-hyphens_v0.1.md"
  contributors: "Just number (1, 2, 3) unless context unclear"
  folders: "lowercase, descriptive (/database/, /docs/guides/)"
  sessions: "session-[id]-[type].txt/md/yaml"

# GitHub Setup
github_setup:
  repository: "https://github.com/Weltentwicklung/commons-space"
  initial_commit: "a5934e3"
  files_uploaded: 8
  lines_added: 3022
  branch: "main"
  
# Challenges Resolved
challenges:
  - issue: "Git commit -F pathspec error"
    solution: "Use relative path with quotes for spaces in filename"
    
  - issue: "Push rejected (remote contains work)"
    solution: "Pull with --allow-unrelated-histories, then push"
    
  - issue: "Session 1 protocol needed GitHub URLs"
    solution: "Created protocol after repository was live"
    
  - issue: "Main folder getting cluttered"
    solution: "Planned reorganization into /database/ and /docs/guides/"

# Notes
notes: |
  Session 2 focused on completing Session 1 documentation and establishing
  the GitHub repository. Major refinements to database structure (persons
  vs entities distinction) and file organization principles.
  
  Key achievement: Establishing clear, simple naming conventions and 
  versioning strategy that eliminates renaming workflows.
  
  Transparency reinforcement: Organizations cannot hide contributors -
  all team members must be visible as individual persons.
